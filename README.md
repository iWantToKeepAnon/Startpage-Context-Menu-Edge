# Startpage-Context-Menu-Edge

UPDATE: I (rjs) rebased the google context search to startpage (ref: https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/edge-search-with-google-context-menu-extension/).  Very minimal changes besides that.

UPDATE: Since now edge supports Startpage search feature if the default search engine is Startpage, this extension is no longer needed for *most* cases. However, I will leave the repo unarchived in case anyone is interested in looking through the code.

To Install this extension on MS Edge, follow the steps below:

Download the Repo and extract it

Go to about:flags in edge and check "Enable extension developer features (this might put your device at risk)" (http://imgur.com/a/490u5) and restart the browser

Click on the three dots menu (...) go to extension --> Load extension

Select the folder you just downloaded - "Startpage Search" (not the folder with readme, just the folder inside it)

Turn on the extension, Restart the browser, and click "Turn on Anyway" when prompted at the bottom
